Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, ensuring that the application works seamlessly in any environment.

Key benefits of Docker:

Consistency: Runs the same across all environments (development, testing, production)

Isolation: Applications run in separate containers without interfering with each other

Portability: Can run on any machine that has Docker installed

Efficiency: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them much lighter than virtual machines

Scalability: Easy to scale applications up or down
